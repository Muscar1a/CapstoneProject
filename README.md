**Please refer to our full report for a detailed description.**

**To check our code, do the following instructions:**

1. Install all required packages that are listed in requirements.txt.

2. Our code are employed in jupyter files. You should change file path to dataset. Our dataset is located "data\healthcare-dataset-stroke-data.csv".

3. To run code, just click **run all** in each ipynb file.

Model results may have slight descrepancies, due to lack of testing of all model hyperparameters.
